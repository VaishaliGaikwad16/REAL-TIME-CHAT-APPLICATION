ABOUT TEAL-TIME-CHAT-APPLICATION
In Task 2 of the CODTECH internship, the goal was to create a Real-Time Chat Application using WebSockets for live communication and React.js for building the front-end (user interface). The main purpose of this task is to let users send and receive messages instantly, just like in WhatsApp or Messenger, without reloading the page.

The chat application has two main parts:

Back-end (Server side):
This is built using Node.js and the ws WebSocket library. It runs on a specific port (for example, localhost:3001) and is responsible for connecting all users together. Whenever someone sends a message, the server sends that message to all the connected users.

Front-end (Client side):
This is created using React.js. It connects to the WebSocket server and shows the chat messages on the screen. It also has an input box where users can type messages and a send button to send them.

Features included in the app:
Users can type and send messages in real time.

Messages are shown instantly to everyone connected.

The interface is simple, clean, and easy to use.

It is responsive â€” meaning it works well on both computers and phones.

Messages keep appearing in the chat window without needing to refresh the page.

The chat UI was styled using CSS to make it neat and user-friendly. It includes a chat area where all messages appear, and a text input box where users can type new messages.

This task helped in understanding how real-time apps like chat messengers actually work behind the scenes. It showed how a server sends and receives messages, and how the front-end updates immediately without delay.

Overall, this project gives a basic but clear idea of how to build a real-time web app where users can communicate instantly.
